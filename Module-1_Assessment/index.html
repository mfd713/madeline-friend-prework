                <p>Madeline hails from her home planet of Middleton, Wisconsin. She spent her nerdling youth reading and writing stories, learning math, making music, and playing vidya games. She then decided it was time to level up her nerdiness by attending Northwestern University. She did the college thing, studying political science and communication studies and spending way too much time with the NU Speech Team. She is excited that she can now honestly say she lives in Chicago. Madeline hopes to one day return to her people and regale them with tales of functioning public transit.
                </p>
                <p>Outside of the working world, Madeline enjoys Irish dance, writing, baking goods, and eating baked goods.
