# Module 2 Assessment: Glee Word Guess Game

This project is a word guessing game (aka Hangman), where the user is prompted to guess the word presented, letter-by-letter.
The word list and styling are themed around the fabulous trainwreck of a TV series, *Glee.*

## How to start
After downloaing and extracting the files to your chosen location, simply open index.html, and press any key to begin guessing.

## Notes
* If you exhaust the word list, you'll have to refresh the page to start over. There are currently 7 words to guess
* You get 12 chances to guess correctly. If you repeat a letter, it won't count against your guesses.
* Guesses reset for each word.
* Any key press counts as a guess, even if it's not a letter, eg. "[", "Capslock", "7".
* The frontend is styled using the Bootstrap framework.
